    "In this project, the task that we will deal with is finding an area in New York to open a restaurant. New York is a huge city, famous for offering any imaginable type of food. Location choice is crucial for such an endeavour, both in terms of the overall area and what type of possible customers it would attract, as well as the existing competition in the neighbourhood. "

    "From previous analysis we have a dataset of the neighbourhoods, their locations and the most common categories of venues for each of them. We have also performed some initial clustering based on the categories of venues available in each of them. This data can be used to provide possible neighbourhoods for further analysis, based on criteria that we will set according to the type of restaurant that we would like to open. \n",

    "We additionally can retrieve data of the venues ratings in order to analyse potential competition and find opportunities for our restaurant. "
